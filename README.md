 BMIcalculator
 A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that calculates an individual's BMI based on their weight and height.

BMI Formula
BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)²

BMI Categories
1. Underweight: BMI < 18.5
2. Normal weight: BMI = 18.5-24.9
3. Overweight: BMI = 25-29.9
4. Obese: BMI ≥ 30

Example Calculation
Weight: 70 kg
Height: 1.75 m

BMI = 70 / (1.75)²
= 70 / 3.0625
= 22.86

According to the BMI categories, a BMI of 22.86 falls into the "Normal weight" category.

You can use online BMI calculators or create your own using the formula above. Keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure, as it does not take into account muscle mass or body composition.
